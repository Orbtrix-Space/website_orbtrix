Build a frontend-only website for a deep-tech space startup using React + Vite + Tailwind CSS.
The codebase must be clean, modular, and scalable, with no hard-coded assumptions that block future expansion.

Design Principles (Important)

Visual style: pure black background, white text, subtle gray accents.

No flashy AI-style UI, no excessive animations, no gradients.

Minimal, engineering-grade layout suitable for a spacetech company.

White company logo placeholder in the navigation bar (logo will be replaced later).

Layout and components should support future additions (links, pages, team members, products).

Global Layout

Top navigation bar with:

Logo placeholder (white, left aligned)

Navigation links: Home, Products, Mission, About, Contact

Navigation should be implemented using a data-driven structure (array/map), not hard-coded JSX.

Responsive but desktop-first.

Home Page

Headline focused on autonomous spacecraft and autonomous space operations.

Emphasize:

Reducing dependence on continuous ground control

Lowering mission operations cost

Clearly communicate:

Software-first approach today

Long-term goal of building highly autonomous spacecraft (hardware + software)

Simple call-to-action linking to Products.

Products Page

Use a scalable product data structure (array of objects).

Product 1 (Primary)

DISHA – Automated Mission Operations Software

Automates mission operations workflows

Reduces manual ground effort

Designed to scale from single missions to more autonomous operations

Product 2 (Future)

Onboard Autonomy Software (Name To Be Announced)

Marked clearly as “In Development”

Enables higher levels of autonomous decision-making onboard spacecraft

Mission Page

Title: Demonstration Mission – 2028

Earth Observation mission

Demonstrates high-end onboard autonomy

Validates reduction in ground operations

Keep content high-level and realistic

About Page

Include a Team section implemented using a scalable data array, not static markup.

Display space for four team members, with role and name only (no photos required now):

Aswin Sunil — CEO & Chief Engineer

Aaron Steephen — Chief Operating Officer (COO)

Jilsha Saji — Space Systems Engineer

Salinimol TA — Mission Planning Engineer

The team layout should:

Easily support adding/removing members later

Be reusable (component-based)

Avoid decorative cards or AI-style visuals

Also include a short paragraph describing the team’s combined experience in:

Mission design

Spacecraft operations

Space systems engineering

Onboard software

Contact Page

Minimal contact section

Placeholder email or simple contact form

No backend logic

Technical Requirements

Frontend only (no Express, no APIs, no backend)

Clean folder structure:

components/

pages/

data/ (for nav, products, team)

No hard-coded UI assumptions

Easy to extend with:

External links

More products

More team members

Future missions
